Introduction
============

This document describes the style guidelines allowed in the markdown documents. The styles are compatible with 
  - pandoc conversion capabilities from markdown to latex
  - doxygen documentation

Headings
========
Headings level in doxygen and latex can be different.
One solution might be to put each markdown document in it's ows section in latex document.

Example
## Headings


Code Style
==========
Highlighting is not supported.

~~~
./configure --enable-hdf5 --enable-netcdf4 --debug
cd build
make

make test
~~~


Figures
=======
Figure size can't be defined in markdown.
In the latex document we can get figures outside document borders
Figure size can be controlled by figures resultion.

Todo: optimal figure resultion


Tables
======
Doxygen support simple_tables only, e.g.:

Param   | Description
------- | ---------------------------------------------
type    | Backend name
id      | Unique identifier string


Captions
========
Captions are not supporteb by doxygen yet.
The raw caption syntax will not be interpreted in the HTML version.
Pandoc support this syntax and will generate Latex tables with captions and labels.

Param   | Description
------- | ---------------------------------------------
type    | Backend name
id      | Unique identifier string

: Caption
